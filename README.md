## Overview
lumiius is an [Espruino](http://espruino.com) powered RGB LED project that I built for my kids to have in their rooms. 

It's easy to build and requires no special tools or wood working. 

I also built a free to use web based IDE that allows you to push new code to the device over the internet. This way you don't need to be physically connected to the Espruino which is useful when the matrix is in your kids room and you need to update the display. 

You can choose to use the lumiius IDE at [https://lumiius.robotictheater.com/ide](https://lumiius.robotictheater.com/ide) or directly flash the apps right to your Espruino. Both versions are available for each app.

## Getting Started


#### 16x16 Grid Version

1. Checkout the build process. I posted the how-to on the main maker sites. Choose your favorite:
   - Make:Projects
   - Hackster
   - Hackaday

2. After you have your Espruino connected to your 16x16 LED matrix, it's time to send it some code.  You can choose to do that either via the cloud or directly below.
   - [Cloud version setup](#cloudversion)
   - [Directly flashed version setup](#cloudversion)

#### LED Strip Version

~~ Currently working on some dispays for this. More information to come. ~~

## Directly Flashed Version
The most common way to get code running on you Espruino is to use the [Espruino IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/). The only downside to this method is flashing new code requires you to be directly connected to your Espruino Wifi via USB.  That is why I also created a cloud version that allows you to push new code to your lumiius over the internet.
