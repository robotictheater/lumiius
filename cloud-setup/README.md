## Cloud Version

### Setup

 1. The cloud version requires the Espruino to connect to your wifi network. Copy and paste the contents of **.boot0** into your Espruino IDE, update with your Wifi credentials and flash to the Espruino storage with the file name .boot0


 2. Next, you need to flash the main lumiius code onto your Espruino. Copy and paste the contents of **.bootcde** into your Espruino IDE and flash it to the Espruino Flash.
 
 
 3. Now, login to the [lumiius IDE](https://lumiius.robotictheater.com/ide) and add your Espruino.  You will be asked to enter your Espruinos serial number.  You can find your devices serial number by running ``getSerial()`` in your Espruino IDE.  
 
 
 4. With your device registered, reboot your Espruino. Once it's successfully online, you will see your device listed in the lumiius IDE with a solid pink indicator showing it is online.
